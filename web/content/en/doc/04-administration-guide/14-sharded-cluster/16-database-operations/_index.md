---

SGShardedDbOps allows you to perform day-2 database operations on sharded clusters, including restarts, resharding, security upgrades, and minor and major version upgrades.

> The `restart` and `securityUpgrade` operations are logically equivalent since the SGShardedCluster version is updated on any restart. These operations can also be performed without creating an SGShardedDbOps by using the [rollout]({{% relref "04-administration-guide/11-rollout" %}}) functionality, which allows the operator to automatically roll out Pod updates based on the cluster's update strategy.

## Available Operations

| Operation | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `restart` | Rolling restart of all pods | Apply configuration changes, clear memory |
| `resharding` | Rebalance data across workers | After adding workers, optimize distribution |
| `securityUpgrade` | Upgrade security patches | Apply security fixes |
| `minorVersionUpgrade` | Upgrade PostgreSQL minor version | Apply PostgreSQL minor releases |
| `majorVersionUpgrade` | Upgrade PostgreSQL major version | Move to a new PostgreSQL major version |

## Restart Operation

### Basic Restart

Restart all pods in the sharded cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: cluster-restart
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
```

### Restart Methods

#### InPlace Restart

Restarts pods without creating additional replicas. Faster but may cause brief unavailability:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: inplace-restart
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  restart:
    method: InPlace
```

#### ReducedImpact Restart

Creates a new replica before restarting each pod, minimizing impact:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: reduced-impact-restart
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  restart:
    method: ReducedImpact
```

### Restart Only Pending

Restart only pods that require a restart (e.g., after configuration change):

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: pending-restart
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  restart:
    method: ReducedImpact
    onlyPendingRestart: true
```

## Resharding Operation (Citus)

Resharding rebalances data distribution across workers. This is essential after adding new workers.

### Basic Resharding

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: rebalance-workers
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: resharding
  resharding:
    citus:
      threshold: 0.1  # Rebalance if nodes differ by 10% in utilization
```

### Threshold Configuration

The `threshold` determines when rebalancing occurs based on utilization difference:

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `0.0` | Always rebalance (aggressive) |
| `0.1` | Rebalance if >10% difference |
| `0.2` | Rebalance if >20% difference |
| `1.0` | Never rebalance |

### Drain-Only Mode

Move all data off specific workers before removal:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: drain-workers
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: resharding
  resharding:
    citus:
      drainOnly: true
```

### Custom Rebalance Strategy

Use a specific Citus rebalance strategy:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: custom-rebalance
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: resharding
  resharding:
    citus:
      threshold: 0.1
      rebalanceStrategy: by_disk_size
```

Available strategies depend on Citus version:
- `by_shard_count`: Balance number of workers (default)
- `by_disk_size`: Balance disk usage

## Security Upgrade

Apply security patches without changing PostgreSQL version:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: security-upgrade
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: securityUpgrade
  securityUpgrade:
    method: ReducedImpact
```

### Security Upgrade Methods

- **InPlace**: Faster, brief unavailability possible
- **ReducedImpact**: Zero-downtime, creates temporary replicas

## Minor Version Upgrade

Upgrade PostgreSQL to a newer minor version. The operation updates the SGShardedCluster
postgres version and then performs a minor version upgrade SGDbOps on the coordinator and
each worker cluster, one at a time:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: minor-version-upgrade
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: minorVersionUpgrade
  minorVersionUpgrade:
    postgresVersion: "16.2"
    method: ReducedImpact
```

### Minor Version Upgrade Methods

- **InPlace**: Faster, brief unavailability possible
- **ReducedImpact**: Zero-downtime, creates temporary replicas

## Major Version Upgrade

Upgrade PostgreSQL to a new major version (see also [`pg_upgrade`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html)).
An SGPostgresConfig for the target major version is required. The operation updates the
SGShardedCluster postgres version and configuration and then performs a major version
upgrade SGDbOps on the coordinator and each worker cluster, one at a time:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: major-version-upgrade
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: majorVersionUpgrade
  majorVersionUpgrade:
    postgresVersion: "16.2"
    sgPostgresConfig: postgres-16-config
    link: true
```

> **Important**: a major version upgrade cannot be performed if a required extension is
>  not available for the target major version. In such cases you may specify the target
>  extension versions using the `postgresExtensions` section. Backups for the previous
>  major version are kept in their paths while new backups will be stored in new paths
>  that can be specified with the `backupPaths` field (one path for the coordinator
>  followed by one path for each worker cluster) or are generated automatically.

While the SGShardedDbOps is running, the SGShardedCluster stops reconciling its child SGClusters
(the names of the created child SGDbOps are tracked in
`SGShardedCluster.status.dbOps.majorVersionUpgrade.sgDbOps`) so that each child SGDbOps is in full
control of the major version upgrade of its SGCluster.

### Manual rollback

The SGShardedDbOps always creates the child SGDbOps with `manualRollback: true`, so each child
[pauses]({{% relref "04-administration-guide/06-database-operations/07-major-version-upgrade/#manual-rollback" %}})
on failure (and, on success, before its cleanup).

- By default (the SGShardedDbOps `manualRollback` is `false`) the decision for each child is taken
  automatically: a failed child is rolled back and a succeeded child is continued/cleaned up.
- When the SGShardedDbOps `manualRollback` is `true`, whenever a child pauses the SGShardedDbOps
  mirrors the child state to its own `.status.majorVersionUpgrade.status`, the operator raises the
  `WaitingRollback` condition, and the SGShardedDbOps waits until you set
  `.status.majorVersionUpgrade.rollback`. That value (`false` to continue assuming a manual upgrade,
  `true` to roll back) is then propagated to the waiting child SGDbOps. The
  `maxErrorsAfterContinueOnFailure` field is propagated to each child as well.

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: major-version-upgrade
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: majorVersionUpgrade
  majorVersionUpgrade:
    postgresVersion: "16.2"
    sgPostgresConfig: postgres-16-config
    link: true
    manualRollback: true
```

```bash
# When the SGShardedDbOps is waiting (condition WaitingRollback=True), resolve it:
kubectl patch sgshardeddbops major-version-upgrade --type merge \
  -p '{"status":{"majorVersionUpgrade":{"rollback":false}}}'
```

## Scheduling Operations

### Run at Specific Time

Schedule an operation for a future time:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: scheduled-restart
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  runAt: "2024-01-20T03:00:00Z"  # Run at 3 AM UTC
  restart:
    method: ReducedImpact
```

### Timeout Configuration

Set a maximum duration for the operation:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: restart-with-timeout
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  timeout: PT2H  # Fail if not completed in 2 hours
  restart:
    method: ReducedImpact
```

### Retry Configuration

Configure automatic retries on failure:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: restart-with-retry
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  maxRetries: 3
  restart:
    method: ReducedImpact
```

## Monitoring Operations

### Check Operation Status

```bash
# List all operations
kubectl get sgshardeddbops

# View detailed status
kubectl get sgshardeddbops cluster-restart -o yaml
```

### Status Fields

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    - type: Running
      status: "True"
      reason: OperationRunning
    - type: Completed
      status: "False"
    - type: Failed
      status: "False"
  opStarted: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  opRetries: 0
  restart:
    pendingToRestartSgClusters:
      - my-sharded-cluster-worker1
    restartedSgClusters:
      - my-sharded-cluster-coord
      - my-sharded-cluster-worker0
```

### Status Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Running` | Operation is in progress |
| `Completed` | Operation finished successfully |
| `Failed` | Operation failed |
| `OperationTimedOut` | Operation exceeded timeout |

### Watch Operation Progress

```bash
kubectl get sgshardeddbops cluster-restart -w
```

## Pod Scheduling for Operations

Control where operation pods run:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: scheduled-maintenance
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  scheduling:
    nodeSelector:
      node-type: maintenance
    tolerations:
      - key: maintenance
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
```

## Operation Examples

### Post-Scaling Rebalance

After adding workers, rebalance data:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: post-scale-rebalance
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: resharding
  resharding:
    citus:
      threshold: 0.0  # Force rebalance
```

### Maintenance Window Restart

Schedule restart during maintenance window:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: maintenance-restart
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: restart
  runAt: "2024-01-21T02:00:00Z"
  timeout: PT4H
  restart:
    method: ReducedImpact
    onlyPendingRestart: true
```

### Emergency Security Patch

Apply urgent security update:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGShardedDbOps
metadata:
  name: urgent-security-upgrade
spec:
  sgShardedCluster: my-sharded-cluster
  op: securityUpgrade
  securityUpgrade:
    method: InPlace  # Faster for urgent patches
```

## Canceling Operations

To cancel a running operation, delete the resource:

```bash
kubectl delete sgshardeddbops cluster-restart
```

Note: Cancellation may leave the cluster in an intermediate state. Review cluster status after cancellation.

## Best Practices

1. **Use ReducedImpact for production**: Minimizes downtime during operations
2. **Schedule during low-traffic periods**: Use `runAt` for maintenance windows
3. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Prevent operations from running indefinitely
4. **Monitor operations**: Watch progress and be ready to intervene
5. **Backup before major operations**: Create backup before resharding or upgrades
6. **Test in staging**: Validate operations in non-production first
