The `replicateFrom` feature is explained in the [SGCluster CRD]({{% relref "06-crd-reference/01-sgcluster/#sgclusterspecreplicatefrom" %}}) but here is a practical guide to accomplish the setup.

Since `replicateFrom` works through the Patroni [*Standby Cluster* concept](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standby_cluster.html), when using streaming replication, it is required that the main cluster leader member or a simple stand alone Postgres server, is accessible from the new cluster replica. Based on the DC architecture or k8s Cloud provider, enabling connections to the WAN must be done. Beforehand, consider that in k8s a service should be ready to expose the cluster service.

StackGres requires to setup 3 users in the `replicateFrom` spec using the specific keys `superuser`, `replication`, and `authenticator` (that may be the same user in the source server) in order to properly functioning. The 3 (or 2 or 1) users must exists in the main cluster that is being replicated. To create each of those users you can fallow the next commad examples:

* Superuser username:
```
CREATE ROLE postgres;
```
* Superuser password:
```
ALTER ROLE postgres WITH SUPERUSER INHERIT CREATEROLE CREATEDB LOGIN REPLICATION BYPASSRLS PASSWORD '***';
```
* Replication username:
```
CREATE ROLE replicator;
```
* Replication password:
```
ALTER ROLE replicator WITH NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEROLE NOCREATEDB LOGIN REPLICATION NOBYPASSRLS PASSWORD '***';
```
* Authenticator username:
```
CREATE ROLE authenticator;
```
* Authenticator password:
```
ALTER ROLE authenticator WITH SUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEROLE NOCREATEDB LOGIN NOREPLICATION NOBYPASSRLS PASSWORD '***';
```

> More details can be found in the [CRD reference]({{% relref "06-crd-reference/01-sgcluster/#sgclusterspecconfigurationscredentialsusers"%}})

Once access is granted, the next command can be used to test the connection:

```sh
psql -U <USER> -p 5433 -h <HOST> -d <database>
```

Then, the new StackGres Cluster will require the credentials for the users that will connect to the main Cluster. Since credentials are being present here, it should be saved into a `Secret`.
Te next example helps to understand how to create it, using the same names from the example above:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  authenticator-password: ***
  authenticator-username: authenticator
  replication-password: ***
  replication-username: replicator
  superuser-password: ***
  superuser-username: postgres
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    app: StackGresCluster
    stackgres.io/cluster-name: my-db
  name: mysecrets-db
  namespace: my-namespace
type: Opaque
EOF
```

In the new remote StackGres deployment, where a new StackGres Cluster will be created as Standby Leader, equal CRDs are required before proceed. Create them accordingly as follows:

- Namespace
- StorageClass - Setting up the same storage or better performance is strongly recommended.
- SGInstanceProfile
- SGPostgresConfig
- SGPoolingConfig
- Service
- SGBackupConfig (if any)
- SGScript (if any)
- Secrets

Now, the environment is ready for the SGCluster to be created. The next example contains extra entries to give a wider view of the options included in a production-like system. Beware of review and complete fields as backups (if you will take backups from your Standby Cluster), the number of instances, and the port number exposed in the main cluster among others.

```yml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGCluster
metadata:
  name: my-db
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  configurations:
    backups:
    - compression: lz4
      cronSchedule: 0 0 1 * *
      performance:
        uploadDiskConcurrency: 1
      reconciliationTimeout: 300
      retention: 1

    sgPoolingConfig: poolconfig
    sgPostgresConfig: pgconfig

  replicateFrom:
    instance:
      external:
        host: 1.2.3.4
        port: 30001
    users:
      superuser:
        username:
          name: mysecrets-db
          key: superuser-username
        password:
          name: mysecrets-db
          key: superuser-password
      replication:
        username:
          name: mysecrets-db
          key: replication-username
        password:
          name: mysecrets-db
          key: replication-password
      authenticator:
        username:
          name: mysecrets-db
          key: authenticator-username
        password:
          name: mysecrets-db
          key: authenticator-password
```

If there are no errors, the new pods should be created, but the patroni container will not be ready until the replica catch up with the leader. Take into account that depending on the data size and the network bandwith it could take several hours. When the replica is ready, we should look the output of the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl -n my-namespace exec -it my-db-0 -c patroni -- patronictl list 
+ Cluster: my-db (7202191435613375243) ------+-----------+----+-----------+
| Member       | Host            | Role           | State     | TL | Lag in MB |
+--------------+-----------------+----------------+-----------+----+-----------+
| my-db-0 | 1.2.3.4:7433 | Standby Leader | streaming | 1 |           |
+--------------+-----------------+----------------+-----------+----+-----------+
```
