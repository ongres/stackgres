The `SGBackup` custom resource represents a backup of the Postgres cluster.
Backups are created automatically by a cron job configured using the settings in the [backup configuration]({{% relref "06-crd-reference/01-sgcluster" %}}#sgclusterspecconfigurationsbackupsindex) or manually by creating a `SGBackup`.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1

  sgCluster: stackgres

The SGBackup represents a manual or automatically generated backup of an SGCluster configured with an SGObjectStorage.

When a SGBackup is created a Job will perform a full backup of the database and update the status of the SGBackup
 with the all the information required to restore it and some stats (or a failure message in case something unexpected
 happened).
After an SGBackup is created the same Job performs a reconciliation of the backups by applying the retention window
 that has been configured in the SGObjectStorage and removing the backups with managed lifecycle and the WAL files older
 than the ones that fit in the retention window. The reconciliation also removes backups (excluding WAL files) that do
 not belongs to any SGBackup. If the target storage of the SGObjectStorage is changed deletion of an SGBackup backups
 with managed lifecycle and the WAL files older than the ones that fit in the retention window and of backups that do
 not belongs to any SGBackup will not be performed anymore on the previous storage, only on the new target storage.
