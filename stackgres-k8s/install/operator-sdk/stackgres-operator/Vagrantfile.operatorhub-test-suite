# This Vagrantfile is used in order to build a virtual image that runs the OperatorHub test-suite: https://k8s-operatorhub.github.io/community-operators/operator-test-suite/
#
# Bring it up with:
#
# VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=stackgres-k8s/install/operator-sdk/stackgres-operator/Vagrantfile.operatorhub-test-suite vagrant up
#
# After merging the operator bundle to the OperatorHub repository with the following script from folder `stackgres-k8s/install/operator-sdk/stackgres-operator`:
#
# ```
# . ~/.stackgres/operator-bundle-operatorhub-config && sh deploy-to-operatorhub.sh
# ```
# 
# You will be able to test the operator with OperatorHub test suite using the following command:
#
# ```
# export VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=Vagrantfile.operatorhub-test-suite
# tar cf target/fork-operatorhub.tar target/fork-operatorhub
# vagrant upload target/fork-operatorhub.tar
# vagrant ssh
# # Then inside the ssh shell
# tar xf fork-operatorhub.tar
# cd target/fork-operatorhub
# export OPP_DEBUG=3 GITHUB_OUTPUT=/dev/stdout
# bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-pipeline/ci/latest/ci/scripts/opp.sh) all operators/stackgres/"<latest version>"
# ```

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Disable the default share of the current code directory. Doing this
  # provides improved isolation between the vagrant box and your host
  # by making sure your Vagrantfile isn't accessible to the vagrant box.
  # If you use this you may want to enable additional shared subfolders as
  # shown above.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    vb.gui = false
 
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.memory = "8192"
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
