            A manual or automatically generated backup of an SGCluster configured with an SGBackupConfig.

            When a SGBackup is created a Job will perform a full backup of the database and update the status of the SGBackup
             with the all the information required to restore it and some stats (or a failure message in case something unexpected
             happened).
            After an SGBackup is created the same Job performs a reconciliation of the backups by applying the retention window
             that has been configured in the SGBackupConfig and removing the backups with managed lifecycle and the WAL files older
             than the ones that fit in the retention window. The reconciliation also removes backups (excluding WAL files) that do
             not belongs to any SGBackup. If the target storage of the SGBackupConfig is changed deletion of an SGBackup backups
             with managed lifecycle and the WAL files older than the ones that fit in the retention window and of backups that do
             not belongs to any SGBackup will not be performed anymore on the previous storage, only on the new target storage.

                            Continuous Archiving backups are composed of periodic *base backups* and all the WAL segments produced in between those base backups. This parameter specifies at what time and with what frequency to start performing a new base backup.

                            Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:
                            *  `m`: minute, 0 to 59
                            *  `h`: hour, 0 to 23
                            *  `dom`: day of month, 1 to 31 (recommended not to set it higher than 28)
                            *  `mon`: month, 1 to 12
                            *  `dow`: day of week, 0 to 7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday)

                            Also ranges of values (`start-end`), the symbol `*` (meaning `first-last`) or even `*/N`, where `N` is a number, meaning every `N`, may be used. All times are UTC. It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as base backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.

                            If not provided, full backups will be performed each day at 05:00 UTC

                            Based on this parameter, an automatic retention policy is defined to delete old base backups.
                            This parameter specifies the number of base backups to keep, in a sliding window.
                            Consequently, the time range covered by backups is `periodicity*retention`, where `periodicity` is the separation between backups as specified by the `cronSchedule` property.

                            Default is 5.

                            Continuous Archiving backups are composed of periodic *base backups* and all the WAL segments produced in between those base backups. This parameter specifies at what time and with what frequency to start performing a new base backup.

                            Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:
                            *  `m`: minute, 0 to 59
                            *  `h`: hour, 0 to 23
                            *  `dom`: day of month, 1 to 31 (recommended not to set it higher than 28)
                            *  `mon`: month, 1 to 12
                            *  `dow`: day of week, 0 to 7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday)

                            Also ranges of values (`start-end`), the symbol `*` (meaning `first-last`) or even `*/N`, where `N` is a number, meaning every `N`, may be used. All times are UTC. It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as base backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.

                            If not provided, full backups will be performed each day at 05:00 UTC

                            Based on this parameter, an automatic retention policy is defined to delete old base backups.
                            This parameter specifies the number of base backups to keep, in a sliding window.
                            Consequently, the time range covered by backups is `periodicity*retention`, where `periodicity` is the separation between backups as specified by the `cronSchedule` property.

                            Default is 5.
