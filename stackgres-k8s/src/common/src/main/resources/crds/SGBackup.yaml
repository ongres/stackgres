            A manual or automatically generated backup of an SGCluster configured with backups.

            When a SGBackup is created a Job will perform a full backup of the database and update the status of the SGBackup
             with the all the information required to restore it and some stats (or a failure message in case something unexpected
             happened).
            Backup generated by SGBackup are stored in the object storage configured with an SGObjectStorage together with the WAL
             files or in a [VolumeSnapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) (separated from the WAL files that will be still stored in an object storage)
             depending on the backup configuration of the targeted SGCluster.
            After an SGBackup is created the same Job performs a reconciliation of the backups by applying the retention window
             that has been configured in the SGCluster and removing the backups with managed lifecycle and the WAL files older
             than the ones that fit in the retention window. The reconciliation also removes backups (excluding WAL files) that do
             not belongs to any SGBackup (including copies). If the target storage is changed deletion of an SGBackup backups with
             managed lifecycle and the WAL files older than the ones that fit in the retention window and of backups that do not
             belongs to any SGBackup will not be performed anymore on the previous storage, only on the new target storage.
            If the reconciliation of backups fails the backup itself do not fail and will be re-tried the next time a SGBackup
             or shecduled backup Job take place.
