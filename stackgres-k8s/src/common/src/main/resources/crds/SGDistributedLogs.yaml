                  Name of the Distributed Logs cluster. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                  A Distributed Logs cluster may store logs for zero or more SGClusters.

                  The name must be unique across all SGCluster, SGShardedCluster and SGDistributedLogs in the same namespace.
