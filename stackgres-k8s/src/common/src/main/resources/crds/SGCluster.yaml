                  Name of the StackGres cluster. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                  The name must be unique across all SGCluster, SGShardedCluster and SGDistributedLogs in the same namespace.

                  This section allows to configure Postgres replication mode and HA roles groups.

                  The main replication group is implicit and contains the total number of instances less the sum of all
                    instances in other replication groups.

                  The total number of instances is always specified by `.spec.instances`.

                  mode:
                    type: string
                    description: |
                      The replication mode applied to the whole cluster.
                      Possible values are:
                      * `async` (default)
                      * `sync`
                      * `strict-sync`
                      * `sync-all`
                      * `strict-sync-all`
                      
                      **async**
                      
                      When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
                        When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
                        will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
                        remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
                        but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
                      
                      **sync**
                      
                      When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
                        transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
                        per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
                        values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
                        means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
                        administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
                        loss.
                      
                      Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
                        standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
                        the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
                        back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
                        makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
                      
                      When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
                        mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
                        signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
                      
                      **strict-sync**
                      
                      When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
                        synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
                        standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
                        transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
                        synchronous replica comes up.

                      **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
                        transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
                        replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
                        visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
                      
                      **sync-all**
                      
                      The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
                        of instances less one.
                      
                      **strict-sync-all**
                      
                      The same as `strict-sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
                        of instances less one.

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.","type":"string"},"resource":{"description":"Required: resource to select","type":"string"}},"required":["resource"],"type":"object"},"secretKeyRef":{"description":"SecretKeySelector selects a key of a Secret.","properties":{"key":{"description":"The key of the secret to select from.

                            Specifies the backup compression algorithm. Possible options are: lz4, lzma, brotli. The default method is `lz4`. LZ4 is the fastest method, but compression ratio is the worst. LZMA is way slower, but it compresses backups about 6 times better than LZ4. Brotli is a good trade-off between speed and compression ratio, being about 3 times better than LZ4.

                            Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:
                            *  `m`: minute, 0 to 59.
                            *  `h`: hour, 0 to 23.
                            *  `dom`: day of month, 1 to 31 (recommended not to set it higher than 28).
                            *  `mon`: month, 1 to 12.
                            *  `dow`: day of week, 0 to 7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday).
                            
                            Also ranges of values (`start-end`), the symbol `*` (meaning `first-last`) or even `*/N`, where `N` is a number, meaning ""every `N`, may be used. All times are UTC. It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as base backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.
                            
                            If not set, full backups are never performed automatically.

                              Specify the [recovery_target](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/recovery_target/) that specifies that recovery should end as soon as a consistent
                                state is reached, i.e., as early as possible. When restoring from an online backup, this means the point where taking the backup ended.

                                Technically, this is a string parameter, but 'immediate' is currently the only allowed value.

                              Specify the [recovery_target_timeline](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/recovery_target_timeline/) to recover into a particular timeline.
                                The default is to recover along the same timeline that was current when the base backup was taken. Setting this to latest recovers to the latest
                                timeline found in the archive, which is useful in a standby server. Other than that you only need to set this parameter in complex re-recovery
                                situations, where you need to return to a state that itself was reached after a point-in-time recovery.

                                recovery target (true), or just before the recovery target (false). Applies when targetLsn, pointInTimeRecovery, or targetXid is specified. This
                                setting controls whether transactions having exactly the target WAL location (LSN), commit time, or transaction ID, respectively, will be included
                                in the recovery. Default is true.

                                (created with pg_create_restore_point()) to which recovery will proceed.

                                Keep in mind that while transaction IDs are assigned sequentially at transaction start, transactions can complete in a different numeric order.
                                The transactions that will be recovered are those that committed before (and optionally including) the specified one. The precise stopping point
                                is also influenced by targetInclusive.
                          targetLsn:

                                recovery will proceed. The precise stopping point is also influenced by targetInclusive. This parameter is parsed using the system data type
                                pg_lsn.

                              Using Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) it is possible to restore the database to its state at any moment in the past by setting `restoreToTimestamp`
                                to a value between the timestamps at which your chosen SGBackup and the subsequent one were taken. If the chosen SGBackup is the latest one, the
                                `restoreToTimestamp` value can be between the timestamps at which that last SGBackup was taken and the current one.

                  StackGres features a functionality for all pods to send Postgres, Patroni and PgBouncer logs to a central (distributed) location, which is in turn another Postgres database. Logs can then be accessed via SQL interface or from the web UI. This section controls whether to enable this feature or not. If not enabled, logs are send to the pod's standard output.
