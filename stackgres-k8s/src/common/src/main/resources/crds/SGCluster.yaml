                    Name of the StackGres cluster. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                    The name must be unique across all SGCluster, SGShardedCluster and SGDistributedLogs in the same namespace.

                      description: |
                        The replication mode applied to the whole cluster.
                        Possible values are:
                        * `async` (default)
                        * `sync`
                        * `strict-sync`
                        * `sync-all`
                        * `strict-sync-all`
                        
                        **async**
                        
                        When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
                         When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
                         will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
                         remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
                         but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
                        
                        **sync**
                        
                        When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
                         transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
                         per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
                         values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
                         means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
                         administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
                         loss.
                        
                        Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
                         standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
                         the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
                         back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
                         makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
                        
                        When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
                         mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
                         signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
                        
                        **strict-sync**
                        
                        When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
                         synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
                         standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
                         transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
                         synchronous replica comes up.

                        **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
                         transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
                         replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
                         visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
                        
                        **sync-all**
                        
                        The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
                         of instances less one.
                        
                        **strict-sync-all**
                        
                        The same as `strict-sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
                         of instances less one.

As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.

In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.\n\nThis is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).","format":"int32","type":"integer"},"nodeAffinityPolicy":{"description":"NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew.

                        Each pod contains a sidecar with a connection pooler (currently: [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/)). The connection pooler is implemented as a sidecar.

                        If not set, a default configuration will be used. Disabling connection pooling altogether is possible if the disableConnectionPooling property of the pods object is set to true.

Brotli is a good trade-off between speed and compression ratio, being about 3 times better than LZ4.

                              Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:
                              *  `m`: minute, 0 to 59.

It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as base backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.
                              
                              If not set, full backups are performed each day at 05:00 UTC.

                                 state is reached, i.e., as early as possible. When restoring from an online backup, this means the point where taking the backup ended.

                                 The default is to recover along the same timeline that was current when the base backup was taken. Setting this to latest recovers to the latest
                                 timeline found in the archive, which is useful in a standby server. Other than that you only need to set this parameter in complex re-recovery

                                 recovery target (true), or just before the recovery target (false). Applies when targetLsn, pointInTimeRecovery, or targetXid is specified. This
                                 setting controls whether transactions having exactly the target WAL location (LSN), commit time, or transaction ID, respectively, will be included
                                 in the recovery. Default is true.

                                 Keep in mind that while transaction IDs are assigned sequentially at transaction start, transactions can complete in a different numeric order.
                                 The transactions that will be recovered are those that committed before (and optionally including) the specified one. The precise stopping point
                                 is also influenced by targetInclusive.

                                 to a value between the timestamps at which your chosen SGBackup and the subsequent one were taken. If the chosen SGBackup is the latest one, the
                                 `restoreToTimestamp` value can be between the timestamps at which that last SGBackup was taken and the current one.
