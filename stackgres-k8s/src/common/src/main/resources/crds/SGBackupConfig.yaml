                  Name of the Backup Configuration. StackGres supports [Continuous Archiving](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html)-based backups which are performed automatically, helping achieve near-zero data loss in case of recovery from a backup. An SGBackupConfig contains the necessary configuration to perform these automatic backups and may be referenced by zero or more SGClusters, and if so it would be referenced by its name. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                  The name must be unique across all backup configurations in the same namespace.

                      Continuous Archiving backups are composed of periodic *base backups* and all the WAL segments produced in between those base backups. This parameter specifies at what time and with what frequency to start performing a new base backup.

                      Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:
                      *  `m`: minute, 0 to 59.
                      *  `h`: hour, 0 to 23.
                      *  `dom`: day of month, 1 to 31 (recommended not to set it higher than 28).
                      *  `mon`: month, 1 to 12.
                      *  `dow`: day of week, 0 to 7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday).

                      Also ranges of values (`start-end`), the symbol `*` (meaning `first-last`) or even `*/N`, where `N` is a number, meaning ""every `N`, may be used. All times are UTC. It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as base backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.

                      If not set, full backups are performed everyday at 05:00 UTC.
                  retention:

                    description: |
                      Define the number of backups with managed lifecycle to keep, in a sliding window.

                      Consequently, the time range covered by backups is `periodicity*retention`, where `periodicity` is the separation between backups as specified by the `cronSchedule` property.

                      WAL files before the oldest backup with managed lifecycle will also be removed. So that, when retention is applied, the oldest WAL available will be `periodicity*retention` old.

                      Default is 5.

                      Specifies the backup compression algorithm. Possible options are: lz4, lzma, brotli. The default method is `lz4`. LZ4 is the fastest method, but compression ratio is the worst. LZMA is way slower, but it compresses backups about 6 times better than LZ4. Brotli is a good trade-off between speed and compression ratio, being about 3 times better than LZ4.
