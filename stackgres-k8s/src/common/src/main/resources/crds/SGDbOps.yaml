                        description: |
                          Perform just a selected set of the normal initialization steps. init_steps specifies the initialization steps to be performed, using one character per step. Each step is invoked in the specified order. The default is dtgvp. The available steps are:
  
                          * `d` (Drop): Drop any existing pgbench tables.
                          * `t` (create Tables): Create the tables used by the standard pgbench scenario, namely pgbench_accounts, pgbench_branches, pgbench_history, and pgbench_tellers.
                          * `g` or `G` (Generate data, client-side or server-side): Generate data and load it into the standard tables, replacing any data already present.
                            With `g` (client-side data generation), data is generated in pgbench client and then sent to the server. This uses the client/server bandwidth extensively through a COPY. pgbench uses the FREEZE option with version 14 or later of PostgreSQL to speed up subsequent VACUUM, unless partitions are enabled. Using g causes logging to print one message every 100,000 rows while generating data for the pgbench_accounts table.
                            With `G` (server-side data generation), only small queries are sent from the pgbench client and then data is actually generated in the server. No significant bandwidth is required for this variant, but the server will do more work. Using G causes logging not to print any progress message while generating data.
                            The default initialization behavior uses client-side data generation (equivalent to g).
                          * `v` (Vacuum): Invoke VACUUM on the standard tables.
                          * `p` (create Primary keys): Create primary key indexes on the standard tables.
                          * `f` (create Foreign keys): Create foreign key constraints between the standard tables. (Note that this step is not performed by default.)

                      A major version upgrade can not be performed if a required extension is not present for the target major version of the upgrade.
                      In those cases you will have to provide the target extension version of the extension for the target major version of postgres.
                      Beware that in some cases it is not possible to upgrade an extension alongside postgres. This is the case for PostGIS or timescaledb.
                       In such cases you will have to upgrade the extension before or after the major version upgrade. Please make sure you read the
                       documentation of each extension in order to understand if it is possible to upgrade it during a major version upgrade of postgres.
