                    Name of the Database Operation. A database operation represents a ""kind"" of operation on a StackGres cluster, classified by a given name. The operation reference one SGCluster by its name. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 `label`, an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 21 characters, with the '-' character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                    The name must be unique across all database operations in the same namespace."

                                Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint
                                 keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to
                                 match all values and all keys.

                                Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists
                                 and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that
                                 a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the
                                 value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                                 When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                                TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of
                                 effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                 it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                 negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                    The kind of operation that will be performed on the SGCluster. Available operations are:

                    * `benchmark`: run a benchmark on the specified SGCluster and report the results in the status.
                    * `vacuum`: perform a [vacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) operation on the specified SGCluster.
                    * `repack`: run [`pg_repack`](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack) command on the specified SGCluster.
                    * `majorVersionUpgrade`: perform a major version upgrade of PostgreSQL using [`pg_upgrade`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html) command.
                    * `restart`: perform a restart of the cluster.
                    * `minorVersionUpgrade`: perform a minor version upgrade of PostgreSQL.
                    * `securityUpgrade`: perform a security upgrade of the cluster.
                    * `upgrade`: perform a operator API upgrade of the cluster

                    An ISO 8601 duration in the format `PnDTnHnMn.nS`, that specifies a timeout after which the operation execution will be canceled.

                    If the operation can not be performed due to timeout expiration, the condition `Failed` will have a status of `True` and the reason will be `OperationTimedOut`.

                    If not specified the operation will never fail for timeout expiration.
                maxRetries:

                    A value of `0` (zero) means no retries are made. Can not be greater than `10`. Defaults to: `0`.
