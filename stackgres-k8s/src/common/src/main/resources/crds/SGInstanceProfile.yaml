                    Name of the Instance Profile. An instance profile represents a ""kind"" of server (CPU and RAM) where you may run StackGres, classified by a given name. The profile may be referenced by zero or more SGClusters, and if so it would be referenced by its name. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                    The name must be unique across all instance profiles in the same namespace."

                    CPU(s) (cores) used for every instance of a SGCluster. Please note that every StackGres pod contains not only the Patroni+Postgres container, but several other sidecar containers. While the majority of the resources are devoted to the main Postgres container, some CPU is needed for the sidecars.

                    The number of cores set is split between all the containers.

                    A minimum of 2 cores is recommended.

                    RAM allocated to every instance of a SGCluster. The suffix `Mi` or `Gi` specifies Mebibytes or Gibibytes, respectively.
