                  Name of the Instance Profile. An instance profile represents a "kind" of
                    server (CPU and RAM) where you may run StackGres Pods, classified by a given name.
                    The profile may be referenced by zero or more SGClusters, and if so it would
                    be referenced by its name. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                  The name must be unique across all instance profiles in the same namespace.

                  This section allow to configure the resources requests for each container and, if not specified, it is filled with some defaults based on the fields `.spec.cpu` and `.spec.memory` will be set.

                  On containerized environments, when running production workloads, enforcing container's resources requirements requests to be equals to the limits in order to achieve the highest level of performance. Doing so, reduces the chances of leaving
                   the workload with less resources than it requires. It also allow to set [static CPU management policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/#static-policy) that allows to guarantee a pod the usage exclusive CPUs on the node.
                   There are cases where you may need to set cpu requests to the same value as cpu limits in order to achieve static CPU management policy.

                  By default the resources requests values in fields `.spec.requests.cpu` and `.spec.requests.memory` represent the total resources requests assigned to each resource's Pod that reference this SGInstanceProfile.
                   The resources requests of the patroni container (that runs both Patroni and PostgreSQL) is calculated by subtracting from the total resources requests the resources requests of other containers that are present in the Pod.
