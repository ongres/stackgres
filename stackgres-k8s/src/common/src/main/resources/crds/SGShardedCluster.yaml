                  The sharding technology that will be used for the sharded cluster.
                  
                  Available technologies are:
                  
                  * `citus`
                  * `ddp`
                  * `shardingsphere`
                  
                  **Citus**
                  
                  Citus is a PostgreSQL extension that transforms Postgres into a distributed database—so you can achieve high performance at any scale.
                  
                  See also https://github.com/citusdata/citus
                  
                  **DDP**
                  
                  DDP (Distributed Data Partitioning) allows you to distribute data across different physical nodes to improve the query performance of high data volumes, taking advantage of distinct nodes’ resources. Using the entry point named coordinator in charge of sending/distributing the queries to different nodes named shards.
                  
                  **ShardingSphere**
                  
                  Apache ShardingSphere is an ecosystem to transform any database into a distributed database system, and enhance it with sharding, elastic scaling, encryption features & more.
                  
                  StackGres implementation of ShardingSphere as a sharding technology uses the [ShardingSphere Proxy](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/quick-start/shardingsphere-proxy-quick-start/) as an entry point to distribute SQL traffic among the shards.
                  
                  This implementation requires the [ShardingSphere Operator](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/oncloud/current/en/user-manual/cn-sn-operator/) to be installed and will create a ComputeNode

                      statement. After an extension is deployed correctly it will be present until removed and the cluster restarted.
                      
                      A cluster restart is required for:
                      * Extensions that requires to add an entry to [`shared_preload_libraries`](https://postgresqlco.nf/en/doc/param/shared_preload_libraries/) configuration parameter.
                      * Upgrading extensions that overwrite any file that is not the extension''s control file or extension''s script file.
                      * Removing extensions. Until the cluster is not restarted a removed extension will still be available.
                      * Install of extensions that require extra mount. After installed the cluster will require to be restarted.

                      The replication mode applied to the whole cluster.
                      Possible values are:
                      * `async` (default)
                      * `sync`
                      * `strict-sync`
                      * `sync-all`
                      * `strict-sync-all`
                      
                      **async**
                      
                      When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
                        When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
                        will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
                        remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
                        but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
                      
                      **sync**
                      
                      When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
                        transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
                        per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
                        values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
                        means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
                        administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
                        loss.
                      
                      Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
                        standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
                        the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
                        back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
                        makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
                      
                      When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
                        mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
                        signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
                      
                      **strict-sync**
                      
                      When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
                        synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
                        standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
                        transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
                        synchronous replica comes up.

                      **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
                        transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
                        replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
                        visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.

                            Use cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.","type":"string"},"resource":{"description":"Required: resource to select","type":"string"}},"required":["resource"],"type":"object"},"secretKeyRef":{"description":"SecretKeySelector selects a key of a Secret.","properties":{"key":{"description":"The key of the secret to select from.

                          The replication mode applied to the whole cluster.
                          Possible values are:
                          * `async` (default)
                          * `sync`
                          * `strict-sync`
                          * `sync-all`
                          * `strict-sync-all`
                          
                          **async**
                          
                          When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
                          When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
                          will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
                          remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
                          but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
                          
                          **sync**
                          
                          When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
                          transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
                          per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
                          values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
                          means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
                          administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
                          loss.
                          
                          Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
                          standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
                          the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
                          back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
                          makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
                          
                          When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
                          mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
                          signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
                          
                          **strict-sync**
                          
                          When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
                          synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
                          standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
                          transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
                          synchronous replica comes up.

                          **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
                          transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
                          replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
                          visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
                          
                          **sync-all**
                          
                          The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
                          of instances less one.

                      When no profile is set, a default (1 core, 2 GiB RAM) one is used.

                            in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is
                            ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order.
                            The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired
                            scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.
