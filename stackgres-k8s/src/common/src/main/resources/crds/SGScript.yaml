                  Name of the StackGres script. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                  The name must be unique across all StackGres scripts in the same namespace. The full script name includes the namespace in which the script is created.

                          script entry in the table `managed_sql.status` that will be created in the specified `database`. This
                          will avoid an operation that fails partially to be unrecoverable requiring the intervention from the user
