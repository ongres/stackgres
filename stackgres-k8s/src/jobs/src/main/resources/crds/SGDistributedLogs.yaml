                    Name of the Distributed Logs cluster. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                    A Distributed Logs cluster may store logs for zero or more SGClusters.

                    The name must be unique across all Distributed Logs and StackGres clusters in the same namespace. The full cluster name includes the namespace in which the cluster is created.

                        It is a best practice, on non-containerized environments, when running production workloads, to run each database server on a different server (virtual or physical), i.e., not to co-locate more than one database server per host.

                        The same best practice applies to databases on containers. By default, StackGres will not allow to run more than one StackGres or Distributed Logs pod on a given Kubernetes node. If set to `true` it will allow more than one StackGres pod per node.
