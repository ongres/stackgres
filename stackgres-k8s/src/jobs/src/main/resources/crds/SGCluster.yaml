                    Name of the StackGres cluster. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                    The name must be unique across all StackGres clusters in the same namespace. The full cluster name includes the namespace in which the cluster is created.

                        It is a best practice, on non-containerized environments, when running production workloads, to run each database server on a different server (virtual or physical), i.e., not to co-locate more than one database server per host.

                        The same best practice applies to databases on containers. By default, StackGres will not allow to run more than one StackGres pod on a given Kubernetes node. Set this property to true to allow more than one StackGres pod per node.

                  description: StackGres features a functionality for all pods to send Postgres, Patroni and PgBouncer logs to a central (distributed) location, which is in turn another Postgres database. Logs can then be accessed via SQL interface or from the web UI. This section controls whether to enable this feature or not. If not enabled, logs are send to the pod's standard output.

                      description: |
                        Define a retention window with the syntax `<integer> (minutes|hours|days|months)` in which log entries are kept.
                         Log entries will be removed when they get older more than the double of the specified retention window.

                        When this field is changed the retention will be applied only to log entries that are newer than the end of
                         the retention window previously specified. If no retention window was previously specified it is considered
                         to be of 7 days. This means that if previous retention window is of `7 days` new retention configuration will
                         apply after UTC timestamp calculated with: `SELECT date_trunc('days', now() at time zone 'UTC') - INTERVAL '7 days'`.
